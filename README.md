# Codecademy-Coded-Correspondence

This project was completed as part of the Codecademy Learn Python 3 Course. It demonstrates the application of Python programming skills to cryptography. It involves decoding and encoding messages using classic ciphers, specifically the Caesar and Vigenère ciphers.
The project demonstrates intermediate programming skills including functional programming principles, algorithms, data structures and string manipulation.

## Project Overview

The project includes:

- **Decoding a Caesar Cipher:** Decrypting a message encrypted with a Caesar Cipher, where each letter in the plaintext is shifted by a fixed number of positions in the alphabet.
- **Encoding with a Caesar Cipher:** Encrypting a new message using the Caesar Cipher.
- **Creating Functions for Encoding and Decoding:** Implementing Python functions to handle the Caesar Cipher with any shift value.
- **Brute Forcing Caesar Cipher:** Decoding a message with an unknown shift by trying all possible shifts.
- **Decoding a Vigenère Cipher:** Applying the Vigenère Cipher, a more complex encryption method that uses a keyword to determine the shift for each letter.
